# Music Recommendation Systems
Experimenting with Recommenders systems on a large datasets.

The proprocessing was done using the first part of [this article](https://towardsdatascience.com/how-to-build-a-simple-song-recommender-296fcbc8c85). The files are massive, so it'd be worth using my MusicDataPreprocessing script to save the relevant transformations after downloading the data.

_Surprise_ recommenders were used here, based upon scikit learn modules. A binder tag will soon be implemented in order for the notebool to be used actively instead of just seen statically. 

MusicRecommender builder is an implementation of a recomender system built by hand. The notebook is the most informative file in this repo.
